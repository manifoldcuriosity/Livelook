javascript. soulseek allows users from around the world to connect to each other
directly and share music (and other stuff).

features supported:
* [nat pmp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol) and
[upnp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play) port-forwarding
* chat rooms and private messages (including direct connections)
* browsing user's share lists and vice versa
* searching the network's files and responding to distributed searches
* downloading and uploading with automatically updating share list

i mainly tested this against nicotine-plus, but it works with soulseekqt too.

## example
```javascript
const LiveLook = require('./');
const fs = require('fs');

let livelook = new LiveLook({
    username: 'toadtripler',
    password: 'not my password',
    sharedFolder: './mp3s',
    autojoin: [ 'nicotine' ]
});

livelook.on('error', console.error);

livelook.login((err, res) => {
    if (err || !res.success) {
        return console.log('login failed');
    }

    livelook.on('sayChatroom', msg => {
        console.log(`[${msg.room}] <${msg.username}> ${msg.message}`);
    });

    livelook.on('messageUser', msg => {
        console.log(`<${msg.username}> ${msg.message}`);
    });

    livelook.search('hot dad web love', (err, res) => {
        if (err) {
            return console.error(err);
        }

        res = res.filter(item => item.slotsFree);

        if (!res) {
            console.log('no files found :(');
            return;
        }

        let downloaded = fs.createWriteStream('hot-dad-web-love.mp3');
        res = res.sort((a, b) => a.speed > b.speed ? -1: 0)[0];
        livelook.downloadFile(res.username, res.file).pipe(downloaded);
        downloaded.on('end', () => {
            livelook.messageUser(res.username, `hey thanks for ${res.file}!`);
        });
    });
});
```
## install

	$ npm install --save livelook

## api
### livelook = new LiveLook(args)
create a new `livelook` instance.

```javascript
// args
{
    username: '',
    password: '',
    server: 'server.slsknet.org',
    port: 2242, // port for server above, NOT the port we listen on
    waitPort: 2234, // port for peer server. will retry multiple options if fail
    sharedFolder: './mp3s',
    downloadFolder: './downloads',
    description: 'user biography',
    autojoin: [ 'chatrooms', 'joined', 'automatically' ],
    maxPeers: 100,
    uploadSlots: 2, // maximum uploads allowed at one time
    uploadThrottle: 56 * 1024, // speed to throttle uploads in bytes
    downloadThrottle: 56 * 1024
}
```

### livelook.init([done])
initialize our share list and connect to the soulseek server. you don't need to
call this if you just use login below.

### livelook.login([username, password, done])
login to the soulseek server, and initialize our peer server if it isn't
already. username and password are optional if the instance has them.

### livelook.refreshShareList([done])
re-scan `livelook.sharedFolder` and repopulate `livelook.shareList`. this is
what other users see when they browse us, or when we respond to searches.

### livelook.sayChatroom(room, message)
send a message to a chatroom.

### livelook.leaveChatroom(room)
leave a chatroom and stop receiving messages from it.

### livelook.joinRoom(room)
join a chatroom and start accepting messages from it.

### livelook.messageUser(username, message)
send a private message to a specific user.

### livelook.setStatus(status)
set our online/away status.

`status` can be a `Number` (1 for away, 2 for online), `'away'` or `'online'`.

### livelook.refreshUploadSpeed([done])
re-calculate our upload speed from [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/).

### livelook.getPeerAddress(username, done)
get a peer's ip address and port based on their username.

### livelook.getPeerByUsername(username, done)
get a peer instance based on a username. this will first check our pre-existing
peers, then it tries to make a direct connection to the peer until finally
requesting the server connect the peer to us.

### livelook.getShareFileList(username, done)
get all the files a user is sharing. may take a while as some people share
large amounts of files, and the message must be decompressed.

### livelook.searchUserShares(username, query, done)
search a user's shares for a query. nicotine users max out at 50 by default.

### livelook.getUserInfo(username, done)
get a user's description (biography), picture (avatar) as a buffer,
upload slots, queue size and slots free.

### livelook.getFolderContents(username, folder, done)
get a list of all the files in the specified folder.

### livelook.downloadFile(username, file, [fileStart = 0])
download a file from a user. this returns a `ReadableStream`, and will also
emit a `queue` event with its position if we can't download it immediately. pass
in `fileStart` to indicate where to begin downloading the file in bytes (to
resume interrupted downloads).

### livelook.searchFiles(query, [args = { timeout, max }, done])
search other peers for files. this returns a `ReadableStream` in `objectMode`.
on search results it will emit `data` events containing the following:

```javascript
{ username, file, size, bitrate, vbr, duration, slotsFree, speed, queueSize }
```

if `done` is provided, the terms will be concatted and passed in either after
the timeout finishes or the max results are reached.

## how it works
soulseek is largely peer-to-peer, but still relies on a central server for
chat rooms, messaging, piercing firewalls and finding peers.

### initializing
first we set up a local server to accept peer connections (and port forward with
nat pmp or upnp if possible). then we connect to slsknet.org (or any other
soulseek server) as a separate client and login. we can now begin to chat and
browse.

### finding peers
we can connect to peers by fetching their ip and port based on their username
from the soulseek server, but if they aren't port-forwarded this will fail. the
next step is to send a connection request via the soulseek server to tell them
to connect to us. if this fails, there is no way for them to connect to us. this
is why it's a good idea to enable nat pmp or port forward manually.

### searching
after logging in, we tell the server we're orphaned and have no parents. after
an arbitrary amount of time (usually around 30 seconds), the server gives a list
of potential parents. once we connect to one successfully, we can also become a
parent. our parent will contionously send us search requests from other peers.
we can respond to them directly if we have the results, but also send the
request to all of our children so they can do the same.
